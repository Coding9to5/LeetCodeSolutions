# LeetCodeSolutions
My solutions to various LeetCode problems, written in Kotlin.

I haven't ran ktlint on any of these files to make them look more standardised, because
I loathe with a passion the style of function definitions ktlint uses.

If you want to use any of these solutions, be my guest, but I would recommend you neaten
them up first.

You can find ktlint at https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint
